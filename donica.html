        <p class="cv"><span>Education</span>I have just met you, and I love you. There are a lot of things to be happy about. <a href="#"> Everything</a> that made that giant tree is already <a href="#">contained</a> inside this tiny little seed. How do you know if they’re ready? Well, you never really know. But when they know, you’ll know, you know? We are master of our own fate. You just need to <a href="#">believe</a> in yourself. Prove you are the <a href="#">best.</a> I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. Luck favors the prepared.</p>
        <p class="about"><span>About</span>If you don't think, then you shouldn't talk. <a href="#">The flower</a> that blooms in adversity is the most rare and <a href="#">beautiful</a> of all. Today's special moments are tomorrow's <a href="#">memories.</a> A conscience is that still, small voice that people won't listen to. The only thing predictable about life is its unpredictable ability. If you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew. The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it. I <a href="#">tell</a> myself that I am not <a href="#">afraid.</a></p>
